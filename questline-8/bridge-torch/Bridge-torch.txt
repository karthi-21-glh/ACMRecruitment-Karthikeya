1 and 2 cross -> 2 min
1 returns -> 1 min
7 and 10 cross -> 10 min
2 returns -> 2 min
1 and 2 cross -> 2 min

Total -> 17 min

The two slowest people (7 and 10) cross together, taking only the slower time (10 min). The two fastest (1 and 2) act as torch-shuttles to minimize return time consumption â€” sending the fastest pair back and forth keeps the extra return time consumption small (1 and 2 instead of repeatedly returning a slow person). Other obvious variants (for example, having 1 escort each slow person separately) add more slow crossings and produce larger totals, so 17 is the minimum.
