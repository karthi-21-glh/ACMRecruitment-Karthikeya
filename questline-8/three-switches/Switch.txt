Turn Switch A ON. Leave it on long enough that the bulb would warm up if it is the correct switch.
Turn Switch A OFF, and immediately turn Switch B ON.
Go into the other room and inspect the bulb once:
	If the bulb is lit, it’s controlled by Switch B.
	If the bulb is off but warm to the touch, it’s controlled by Switch A.
	If the bulb is off and cold, it’s controlled by Switch C.
